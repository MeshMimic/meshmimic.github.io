# MeshMimic Project Page

This repository hosts the MeshMimic project page.

MeshMimic is a geometry-aware humanoid motion learning framework that couples 3D scene reconstruction with motion learning from monocular videos. It reconstructs terrains and human trajectories, then transfers contact-consistent interactions to a humanoid agent for robust, long-horizon skills.

Paper: MeshMimic: Geometry-Aware Humanoid Motion Learning through 3D Scene Reconstruction. The paper presents the reconstruction-to-learning pipeline, a kinematic consistency optimization for motion extraction, and contact-invariant retargeting, with results on diverse contact-rich terrains.
